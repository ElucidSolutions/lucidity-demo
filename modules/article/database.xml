      <p>On February 13, 2016, GSA implemented changes to the <strong>Solicitation Clauses</strong> section of the eOffer System. The following changes will be made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In order to capture the most detailed information about your offer, the <strong>Basic Information</strong> template now lists each clause separately by its number and title. You will now be required to complete several screens, as opposed to just one. Depending on the type of clause, the data you enter into each field will be different.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be sure to check the updated version of <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/eoffer-resources/preparing-your-electronic-contract-offer-eoffer/responding-to-solicitation-clauses/responding-to-solicitation-clauses-overview" target="blank">Responding to Solicitation Clauses</a> in the <strong>Preparing Your Electronic Contract Offer (eOffer) Guide</strong>, under <strong>eOffer Resources</strong>.</p>
