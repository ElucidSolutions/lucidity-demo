Lucidity Demo Readme
====================

Welcome to the Lucidity Demo site! This site was created to highlight the capabilities provided by the Lucidity content publishing platform.

Lucidity is an open source publishing platform written entirely in JavaScript. Lucidity was designed to be extremely light-weight, running entirely within the client's browser and requiring no server-side back-end services such as databases and interpreters. Sites built using Lucidity can be served from a simple web accessible directory.

Despite its small footprint, Lucidity provides a wealth of sophisticated features including search, video libraries, and analytics. Lucidity uses a modular architecture and includes a number of sophisticated features within its core modules.

This site was created to highlight some of those features.

Elucid Solutions hosts the Lucidity Demo site which can be found here: http://demo.elucidsolutions.com. We invite you to view some of the features highlighted on this site:

  Lucidity's Video Library module allows site creators to organize videos into collections, provide video and collection summaries, transcript navigation, and video search all in a user-friendly interface and design.

  Lucidity's Embedded Video module goes beyond simple video playback. Using Lucidity, site creators can present auto-scrolling video transcripts and allow users to navigate within videos by clicking on various phrases within transcripts. The demo site includes numerous embedded video player examples.

* Search

  Lucidity's Search module uses Lunr to provide sophisticated search results based on frequency term analysis. The demo site includes a simple implementation of Lucidity's Search module.

* Interactive Lessons

  We created Lucidity's Presentation module to help users learn how to use complex software systems. Each presentation provides an interactive simulation of the eOffer/eMod system and a walkthrough of some process within it. The demo site includes numerous presentations created for the General Services Administration (GSA).

* Nested Pages

  Lucidity's Page blocks allow pages to be nested within each other allowing sophisticated content reuse.

* Analytics

  Track visits to pages within your site using Lucidity's Analytics module. Page visits and search events are automatically recorded using Google Analytics.

* Page Ratings

  Every page includes a user feedback section. User responses are collected and reported as Google Analytics events, providing page level usability feedback.

* Mobile Responsiveness

  The demo site illustrates, the care that we have taken in creating a mobile-first user experience. All of the features presented above reflow across and adapt to mobile devices.
