         <ttm:title>Re-representation of Small Business Type</ttm:title>
         <ttm:desc>Set-aside opportunities for small businesses make it possible for businesses that fall within the guidelines of specific socioeconomic categories to receive fair consideration for government Contracts. These categories include: Woman-Owned Business, Woman Owned Small Business, HUBZone, Veteran Owned Business, and 8(a) Businesses, (eligible small disadvantaged business entities). As part of the Contract Offer process, your company would have been required to certify its socioeconomic Set-aside status. The Re-Representation of Business Type Modification allows you to inform GSA if your Company has received a new small business Set-aside designation.
