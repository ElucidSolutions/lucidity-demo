         <ttm:title>Adding Negotiators</ttm:title>
         <ttm:desc>Authorized Negotiators may be assigned to an Offer with or without the authority to sign, and it is recommended practice to assign multiple Authorized Negotiators to the same Offer in order to ensure consistent representation throughout the Award process. Authorized Negotiators are added to an Offer when it is first created, but can also be added, removed, or have their authority status changed through the Modification process. This video will demonstrate the steps required to add Authorized Negotiators while creating an eOffer, as well as working with the Authorized Negotiator Modification.
