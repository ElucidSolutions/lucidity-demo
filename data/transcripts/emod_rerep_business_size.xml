         <ttm:title>Re-representation of Business Size</ttm:title>
         <ttm:desc>Federal agencies often set aside Contracts for small businesses whose revenue falls under a specific threshold. As part of the Contract Offer process, your Company will have been required to certify that it is or is not a small business. The Re-Representation of Business Size Modification allows you to inform GSA if your Company outgrows its small business designation, meaning it exceeds the revenue threshold that allows it to be categorized as a small business. Or, in the contrary instance, you can inform GSA if your Company size has decreased, meaning that it will qualify as a small business.
