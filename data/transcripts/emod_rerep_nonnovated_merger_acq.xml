         <ttm:title>Re Representation of Non Novated Merger/Acquisition</ttm:title>
         <ttm:desc>A Non-novated Merger or Acquisition implies that all Terms and Conditions of your GSA Contract are not being acquired by or merged with your Company. In the event of a merger or acquisition of this type, you must submit this Mod notifying GSA that such a Non-novated Merger or Acquisition has taken place. Note that if the merger does not require Novation, a different Modification (the Novation Agreement Modification) will be necessary.
