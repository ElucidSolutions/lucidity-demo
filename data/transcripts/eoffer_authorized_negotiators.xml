         <ttm:desc>Users who need access to the eOffer system to work on a particular eOffer must be added as Authorized Negotiators. Multiple Negotiators may be added at one time, which is recommended practice to ensure a representative will be available to sign off on agreements with the government. Note that the Negotiator's name and email address must be entered exactly as they appear on the individual's Digital Certificate.
