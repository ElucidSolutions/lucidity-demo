         <ttm:title>Update/Revise Commercial Sales Practice</ttm:title>
         <ttm:desc>When you submitted your initial Offer, you would have been asked to perform projections as to how much business you planned to do with the government. One of the Solicitation documents that you were required to upload was the CSP-1. You will notice that on some Mods there is a section called &quot;Update/Revise Commerical Sales Practice (CSP-1).&quot; Beginning in August of 2013, all Contract Modifications that could potentially impact the CSP will include the ability to revise the existing CSP-1 associated with your Contract. The primary Mod types within this section include Additions, Deletions, and Pricing.
