			<ttm:desc>eOffer/eMod is a publicly available system; it does not
				reside behind GSA's firewall. Therefore, eOffer/eMod is available to
				any internet user via the url http://eoffer.gsa.gov/. Having said
				that, most of the functionaility discussed in this Guide involves
				signing into a secure portion of the website, and there are a few
				key requirements that need to be satisfied in order for a Vendor to
				actually use the system once signed in.
